The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movie represents a film. This class has the following three properties:

1.title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
2.studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the movie
3.rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)


a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values.

class movie {
  constructor(title, studio, rating) {
    this.title = title;
    this.studio = studio;
    this.rating = rating;
  }

  getrating() {
    return "the rating is  " + this.rating;
  }
}

b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

 
class movie {
    constructor(title, studio, rating){
        this.title = title;
        this.studio = studio;
        this.rating = "PG";
    }
}

d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”

const CasinoRoyale = new movie( "Casino Royal", "Eon Productions", "PG13");
